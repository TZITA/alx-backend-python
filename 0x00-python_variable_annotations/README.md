# PYTHON VARIBALE ANNOTATIONS

## Task 0:
## Basic annotations - add
A type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

## Task 1:
## Basic annotations - concat
A ype-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string.

## Task 2:
## Basic annotations - floor
A type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float.

## Task 3:
## Basic annotations - to string
A type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float.

## Task 4:
## Define variables
Definition and annotation of different varibales.

## Task 5:
## Complex types - list of floats
A type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.

## Task 6:
## Complex types - mixed list
A type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

## Task 7:
## Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
A type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.

## Task 8:
## Complex types - functions
A type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier.

## Task 9:
## Let's duck type an iterable object
Annotation of function parameters.

## Task 10:
## Duck typing - first element of a sequence
Annotations with duck-type.

## Task 11:
## More involved type annotations
Annotations of function parameters.

## Task 12:
## Type Checking
Type checking using mypy.
